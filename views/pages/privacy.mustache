        <h3><b>4.5. HOW CAN YOU TURN OFF PERSONOLIZED ADS?</b></h3>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides specific instruments available to EEA-based users via the Game you can use your device&nbsp; settings. </span>
        </p>
        <p><strong>iOS</strong></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open the “Settings” application of iOS and select the “Privacy” menu item and then the “Advertising” sub-item. If you activate the “Limit ad tracking” option, we can only take limited measures such as identifying unique users or combating fraud. In the same menu you can always delete the IDFA (“Reset Ad-ID”), then a new ID is created which is not merged with the data collected earlier. </span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Android</strong></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open the “Settings” application and select the “Google” menu item. Depending on your device, this option may not be visible on the main menu but you may use the search function at the top of the Settings menu to find it. From there, select the “Ads” sub-item and activate the option “Opt out of Ads Personalisation” to prevent the creation of profiles and the display of personalized advertising. You can delete the advertising ID in the same menu at any time (“Reset advertising ID”), then a new ID will be created which will not be merged with the previously collected data.</span>

Please keep in mind that we will only do that if specifically allowed by you and we will store ID and your full name for the purposes of user identification.
